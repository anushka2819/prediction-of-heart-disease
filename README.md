# Heart Disease Prediction 

## Overview
The **Heart Disease Prediction ** uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on the data. This uses linear and logistic regression.

The prediction is based on a dataset of heart disease records (e.g., UCI Heart Disease dataset) and leverages a machine learning model trained using features like age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and more.

## Features
- Predict heart disease likelihood based on clinical data.
- Easy-to-use web interface for entering patient data.
- Real-time predictions using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- Visualization of feature importance and results.
